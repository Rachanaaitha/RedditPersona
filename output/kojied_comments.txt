Comment: That proximity is ridiculous, deep mining, two fishing huts, vegetable, orchards, and trade iron for malt.
imo trading raw materials is easier than trading crafted goods in the current build. High quantity stuff is easy to stock, and you could have multiple trading posts up without any major issues.
The exact opposite of this is plate armor. It takes forever to build, requires three points, and needs eight iron slabs to make it. It‚Äôs cheaper to just export the ore, and since it‚Äôs a low quantity trade, it‚Äôs hard to stick multiple trade posts with it

Comment: \- the hype has definitely faded, you can see that with the price as well as the number of people discussing it on X, or even here  
\- haven't seen much innovation in the space at all, the momentum seems to have shifted to solana memecoins, and dissipated after that  
\- again, people no longer seem interested. I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well  
\- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.  
\- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT

I see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead

Comment: That‚Äôs a good suggestion. I‚Äôve found the level below to be too easy doing the optimal route, so will try that
============================================================
Comment: The optimal strategy I've discovered is the following

1. rush artist/writer slots and fill them
2. rush renaissance era via acoustics
3. bulb writer to fill rationalism slots
4. if AI wants to be friends, accept (unless negative impact with neighboring civs) and do research agreement
5. internal food routes (usually to city with artist slots)
6. pay neighbors to fight eachother (so you don't get attacked)
7. rush and work science buildings
8. 7 turns (10 if standard speed) after building and rushing research lab (and working the slot), bulb science, beeline for stealth bombers. (if you have a religion use faith to buy 3-4 scientists)
9. if you have the capacity, build out military buildings (up to military academy) so you have air repair
10. go dominate or yeet off to space

I'm usually ahead of AI by the time I build research labs (although they may have more total techs since they fill the science tree more balanced), and left them in the dust when I bulb

It does get a bit boring after a while though, so I'm trying to find ways to diversify the gameplay.

Try to go on the first day if you can, since they do sell out quickly. Be ready to wait an hour or two.¬†

Comment: First of all you look good! But if you want to become more "conventionally attractive", here are some of my suggestions. Just personal opinions, take them or leave them.

  
**Do away with glasses -** 

Have you considered contacts? If not you should look into it. Or lasik although that's a bit pricy (and scary to some). I did it and was the best decision ever.

  
**Work out -** 

make sure to get enough protein and look into creatine as well

I'd recommend losing weight though cardio & eating healthier, as well as build muscle though bench and squats. Don't forget to stretch too since you can injure yourself! And get a gym rat to spot you. Once you start losing weight you'll see your face slim down as well

**Fashion -** 

Uniqlo is a good start, but you gotta dress well in Uniqlo

[https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C\_oENHCPkft](https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C_oENHCPkft)

(If you're in Japan just buy them there it's cheaper haha)

I wouldn't recommend you wearing anime related items if you're trying to be "conventionally attractive". Make it something very subtle, like a tiny totoro tattoo on your wrist, or a ring which doesn't shout ANIMEEEEE! Also if someone asks your about it you can elaborate on your interest, but keep it short and succinct so you don't nerd out until you know they are interested in learning more.

If you can afford it, go one layer above and try Cos

**Eyebrows** **-** 

Go get your brows done at an Indian threading place. Take a picture of it, and try to recreate it via shaver below

**Skincare -** 

You seem to be on the oily side like me. Wash your face daily, and use a decent face cream and serum. Here's the ones I use.

**Hair** \- 

Honestly I don't know. You could grow it out, shave it, or keep as is. If you're going to shave it keep the beard because you gotta keep one of them. If you're worried about balding there's these crazy services in Turkey where they will regrow your hair (example below). My colleague did it and he looked messed up for a month but now looks amazing (not at this particular spot).

[https://cosmedica.com/](https://cosmedica.com/)

  
Last but not least, get yourself out there! Getting experience with women/men whoever you are attracted to, is the best way to build confidence. Make mistakes, learn, and grow as a person.

Wishing the best for you!
============================================================
Comment: I think you should just shave it off entirely. Get this shaver, it's a bit pricy but you'll never have to worry about shaving again (until you get a blade replacement in a few years)

Comment: fyi aircrafts don't get this benefit, so building a city next to it won't be worth it
============================================================
Comment: There are some key technologies which can give you significant advantage in the early game, either in military or in science. The ones for military are composite Bowmans, chariots, crossbow etc, but the great library doesn‚Äôt really help you obtain these since they‚Äôre on the opposite side of the tech tree. As in, if you want to beeline for those it‚Äôs faster to research those tech instead of researching and beelining for great library.

I think the great library can be beneficial in getting to theology faster, which will get you to¬†borobudur. That‚Äôs game changing if you are pushing for religion (which honestly you should unless there are reasons not to).¬†

The great scientist points are great to have early on, although you often use them for bulk popping once you have research labs up and running.

I usually play at deity where the AI starts miles ahead in technology so don‚Äôt even bother, but if you‚Äôre playing king or emperor it should be a decent strat.

Comment: It‚Äôs a combination of multiple factors, your military strength, the amount of GPT/luxury you can offer, their military might, the other civ‚Äôs might, etc.
What seems to impact it the most is how bloodthirsty the AI is. Shaka will go to war with almost anyone, it‚Äôs impossible to get Ghandi to attack, unless he‚Äôs got nukes. I feel that it‚Äôs balanced considering that the violent civs tend to attack you, and those are the ones you can bribe relatively easily.
Even if the civs aren‚Äôt neighbors, if you can get them to declare war on one another they will most likely not attack you, which is already a win. You have the largest disadvantage at the beginning of the game, so it‚Äôs easier to catch up as you invest the resources to non-military infrastructure, while your competitors burn hammers on swords and arrows.
============================================================
Comment: It depends on who‚Äôs my neighbor, if they‚Äôre peaceful it‚Äôs not too hard, unless someone runs away on science. Try to pit them against each other by bribing them to go to war with each other, which might be easier if you have warmongering neighbors.

Comment: The founders may have had good intentions, but they definitely didn‚Äôt deliver on them. As for the brands that veve partnered with, they probably saw it more as a marketing opportunity, and considering how a few people care about NFTs, they see the impact of their apathy as negligible to the overall brand image.¬†
Disney for instance, have received way more flack about trying to use Disney+ terms and conditions on the victim who died in their theme park.¬†
The reality is that mainstream attention has moved away from NFTs (if there ever was any), and so they‚Äôve written it off as one of the many, many things they‚Äôd like to sweep under the rug.
