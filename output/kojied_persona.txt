One of the main concerns among virtual reality enthusiasts and critics regarding the use of VR for education is how it might impact students' focus, attention, and engagement. This concern has been highlighted by numerous studies that have shown a decline in students' scores on standardized tests when they are exposed to VR content. In addition to this, the long-term effects of VR on cognitive development have also been questioned, with some researchers suggesting that it may not be as effective in teaching certain skills as traditional instructional methods.

One study published in the Journal of Cognitive Enhancement in 2017 looked at the impact of a VR game on students' cognitive performance and engagement. The authors found that students who participated in the VR game performed significantly better on a memory task compared to those who watched a video or read text material, indicating that VR may have a positive effect on memory retention.

Another study published in the Journal of Educational Research in 2019 examined the use of VR in educational settings and found that it could be a useful tool for teaching a variety of subjects, including math, science, and social studies. The authors noted that while VR can enhance learning, it should not replace traditional instructional methods or displace them altogether.

Despite these concerns, VR is still in its early stages of development and has the potential to revolutionize education for many students. With advances in technology and design, VR could become a more immersive and engaging learning experience than traditional instructional methods. It remains to be seen whether this will ultimately lead to better student outcomes or not, but for now, it seems that VR is here to stay.
